## Rain Types
A simple interface / class for Rain Types, or difficulties essentially:

###### Default
The current amount of rain. The standard settings of the game, still a challenge but not too difficut.

###### Downpour
Current amount doubled. More difficult, rain deals more damage, and resources are harder to find.

###### Drizzle
Current amount halved. Essentially the "easy-mode."
